# Typecasting-And-Operators
TypeCasting and Operators in Java
This Java project demonstrates various concepts related to type casting and operators in Java.

Description
The TypeCasting class explores different aspects of type casting, including implicit and explicit type casting, parsing integers from strings, and converting between data types. Additionally, the code showcases the use of various operators, such as arithmetic, unary, and binary operators.

Features
Implicit type casting from int to double
Explicit type casting using the cast operator (type)
Parsing integers from strings using Integer.parseInt()
Converting between data types, including int, double, float, and String
Demonstration of arithmetic operators, including addition, multiplication, and increment
Use of unary operators, including negation and increment
Use of binary operators, including addition and multiplication
Code Organization
The TypeCasting class is a single Java file that contains all the code examples. The code is organized into sections, each demonstrating a specific concept or feature.

Running the Code
To run the code, simply compile the TypeCasting.java file and execute the resulting TypeCasting.class file.
